------Lexicographical Order (Dictionary Order)----------

Lexicographical order is the way words are arranged in a dictionary. It follows the rules of alphabetical order, 
comparing characters from left to right.

------------ How It Works  ---------------------------
1. Compare the first letter of both words.
2. If the first letters are the same, move to the next letter and compare.
3. Continue this until a difference is found or one word is completely checked.
4. Shorter words come first if they match up to the length of the shorter word.

------------------- Examples---------------------
Example 1: Simple Words
    Compare "apple" and "banana":

    "a" comes before "b" in the alphabet.
    So, "apple" comes before "banana".

Example 2: Words with Common Prefix
    Compare "cat" and "car":

    First letters: "c" = "c" (same)
    Second letters: "a" = "a" (same)
    Third letters: "t" vs. "r" â†’ "r" comes before "t" in the alphabet.
    So, "car" comes before "cat".

Example 3: One Word is a Prefix of Another
    Compare "bat" and "battery":

    "bat" appears entirely at the start of "battery".
    The shorter word "bat" comes first in lexicographical order.

Example 4: Numbers and Special Characters
    Lexicographical order follows ASCII values, meaning:

    Numbers (0-9) come before letters (A-Z, a-z).
    Uppercase letters (A-Z) come before lowercase letters (a-z).
    "123" comes before "apple", and "Hello" comes before "hello".
